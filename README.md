**FormsPHP**

Project with Frontend in Bootstrap, the main objective is to perform basic commands in the MySQL database, using PHP in the backend to do CRUD.

**Database structure**

Before starting to run the application, I recommend that you create a database with the following structure:
Database: forms
Table: tbforms
Fields: id, name, email, address

Path to edit the connection:
database>config.php
